**Kaibun** (*Japanese:* 回文 or かいぶん, *lit.* 'circle sentence') is a Japanese equivalent of the palindrome, or in other words, a sentence that reads the same from the beginning to the end or from the end to the beginning. The unit of kaibun is mora, since the Japanese language uses syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaibun //
